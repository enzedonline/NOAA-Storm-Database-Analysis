# Summary

This report will find that excessive heat was the biggest killer over the examined period, while tornadoes were the most injurious. Hurricanes and floods had the greatest economic impact with severe drought having the greatest economic impact on crop damage.

# Synopsis

The Storm Events Database contains data and information for the United States, its territories, and possessions. Data are available from 1950 to the present, and the Database contains over 1.2 million records ([*reference*](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/storm-events-database-version-30#:~:text=The%20Storm%20Events%20Database%20contains%20data%20and%20information%20for%20the,contains%20over%201.2%20million%20records)).

Data across all event types has been available since the beginning of 1996 ([*reference*](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/details.jsp?type=eventtype)), as this report is comparing all event types, only events of the period from 1996 until end of 2011 (where the supplied data finishes) were considered and consists of 902,297 event records.

The report addresses two questions:

***Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?***

In terms of death, excessive heat was the cause of the highest mortality count while tornadoes by far caused the greatest amount of injury.

***Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?***

Drought was the cause of the highest economic damage to crops. Hurricanes had the greatest impact on property damage, however, if all flood types were considered a single event type, then these would exceed hurricane damage.

It was found that the singular Hurricane Katrina event contributed to over 25% of the total damage caused by all events over the 16 year period but after removing events linked to Hurricane Katrina, flooding and hurricanes were still the chief cause of economic damage â€“ this is discussed in detail later in the report.

# Data Processing

## Setting Global Defaults

Set caching and echo to `TRUE` 

```{r set_defaults}
# set defaults: cache chunks
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE, echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading required libraries

The following libraries are required to run the code in this analysis and will be installed if not present locally:

`readr`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`, `kableExtra`, `plotly`, `selectr`, `Hmisc`

```{r load_libraries, warning=FALSE}
packages = c('readr', 'dplyr', 'stringr', 'lubridate', 
             'ggplot2', 'kableExtra', 'plotly', 'selectr', 'Hmisc')
package.check <- lapply(
  packages,
  FUN = function(x) {
    if (!require(x, character.only = TRUE)) {
      install.packages(x, dependencies = TRUE)
      library(x, character.only = TRUE)
    }
  }
)
```

## Downloading and Reading the Data

The data is available for [download](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) in bzip2 compressed format. It is downloaded to the subdirectory `./data/raw` which is first created if it doesn't already exist. The file is left compressed due to size.

```{r download_data}
if (!dir.exists('./data/raw')){
  dir.create('./data/raw', recursive = T)
}

download.file(
  "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2",
  "./data/raw/repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2"
)
```

The data is read using `read_csv()` from the `readr` package, selecting only those variables of interest:

```{r read_data}
dfEvents <- read_csv(
  "./data/raw/repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2",
  col_select = c("BGN_DATE", "EVTYPE", 
                 "FATALITIES", "INJURIES", 
                 "PROPDMG", "PROPDMGEXP", "CROPDMG", "CROPDMGEXP",
                 "REFNUM", "REMARKS"),
  col_types = cols(
    BGN_DATE = col_character(),
    EVTYPE = col_character(),
    FATALITIES = col_number(),
    INJURIES = col_number(),
    PROPDMG = col_number(),
    PROPDMGEXP = col_character(),
    CROPDMG = col_number(),
    CROPDMGEXP = col_character(),
    REFNUM = col_number(),
    REMARKS = col_character(),
  )
)
```

## Cleaning the Data

This required several steps:

 1. Subsetting the data
 2. Converting the date column to true date type
 3. Correcting EVTYPE entries to allowed types
 4. Calculating actual cost using the EXP columns 
 5. Adjusting values for inflation
 6. Checking for, and fixing, erroneous entries
 
### Subsetting the data & converting the date column

We are only interested in:

 - events that contribute towards one of the four key indicators (fatalities, injuries, property damage or crop damage)
 
 - events from 1996 as [this is the earliest year when all event types were being recorded](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/details.jsp?type=eventtype)

Before filtering by date, we eliminate non-contributors first to minimise processing:

```{r subset_data}
dfEvents <- dfEvents %>%
  filter(FATALITIES>0 | INJURIES>0 | PROPDMG>0 | CROPDMG>0) %>% 
  mutate(BGN_DATE=mdy(word(BGN_DATE,1))) %>%
  filter(BGN_DATE > '1996-01-01')
head(dfEvents, 10)
dim(dfEvents)
```

The subsetted data now has `r nrow(dfEvents)` rows.

### Correcting EVTYPE entries to allowed types

According to the [National Weather Service Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf), only the following values should be allowed in the recorded EVTYPE:

|                       |                   |                        |

*National Weather Service Storm Data Documentation, Section 2.1.1 Storm Data Event Table*

Very few of the actual recorded events have followed this directive, there are a huge number of variations, mixes and spelling errors to deal with. 

Without classifying the event records properly, any aggregate analysis would be somewhat meaningless.

As many of these entries needed to be examined on case-by-case process, in the end it was more reliable to just map each recorded `EVTYPE` to an actual allowed event type.

The first step for this is to create a mapping list:

```{r evtype_list}

)
```

The mapping process involves finding which element of the list the `EVTYPE` exists in, and using that element name as the corrected value in a new `Event` column:

```{r map_evtypes}
set_allowed_event_type <- function(observation) {
  names(
    which(
      sapply(
        event_types, 
        function(x) any(x == toupper(observation['EVTYPE']))
        )
      )
    )[1]
}

dfEvents <- dfEvents %>% 
  mutate(Event = apply(dfEvents, 1, set_allowed_event_type)) %>%
  relocate(Event, .after = EVTYPE)

dfEvents %>%
  select(BGN_DATE, EVTYPE, Event) %>%
  slice_head(n=10)
```

Note: in the case that an `EVTYPE` has been added more than once to the `event_types` list, only the first result is returned.

The official allowed event types can be somewhat arbitrary (what draws the line between a 'Heat' event and an 'Excessive Heat' event for example?), and this is really a weakness in the analysis. How the entries have been mapped has a direct impact on the final results.

Having said that, it is a simple task to revisit the mapping and rerun the analysis once that has been done if necessary.

In case of future analysis, we convert the list to a dataframe and push out to CSV:

```{r save_evtypes}
max_length <- max(sapply(event_types, length))
event_types <- lapply(
  event_types,function(x) {
    ans <- rep(NA,length=max_length);
    ans[1:length(x)]<- x;
    return(ans)
  }
)
event_types <- do.call(cbind,event_types)

if (!dir.exists('./data/processed')){
  dir.create('./data/processed', recursive = T)
}
write.csv(event_types, './data/processed/map_evtypes.csv', row.names = F)
```


### Calculating actual cost using the EXP columns & adjusting values for inflation
 
#### Inflation 

Since we are comparing costs across a lengthy period of time, we need to adjust values for inflation as the currency devalues with time. $1 Billion in 1996 was worth considerably more than the same value in 2011, at the end of the analysis period.

To get an approximation of inflation over the period, we can use the CPI values for start and end using the following formula:

`(B - A)/A` where `A` is the starting CPI and `B` is the ending CPI

The average annual inflation rate is approximated by dividing this number by the number of years.

The [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) gives the CPI for 1996 as 66.18, and for 2012 as 96.87.

```{r average_inflation}
cpi1996 <- 66.18
cpi2012 <- 96.87
mean_inflation_rate <- (cpi2012-cpi1996)/cpi1996/(2012-1996)
mean_inflation_rate
```

The average inflation rate over this period was `r round(mean_inflation_rate * 100, 2)`%.
 
For each year in the period, we can calculate the equivalent 2012 value using the formula:

`Value2012 = PV Ã— (1 + i)^n` where PV is the recorded value and n is the years until 2012. 

As an example, $1000 in 1996 is calculated as follows:

`$1,000 Ã— (1 + 0.029)^16 = $1,579.96`

We create a row to indicate this n value for each entry and apply it later when we calculate the property and crop costs:

```{r inflation_period}
end_date <- ymd("2012-01-01")
dfEvents <- dfEvents %>%
  mutate(inflation_period = as.numeric(interval(BGN_DATE, end_date) / years(1)))
```

#### Using the EXP Values

The EXP columns have [generated much discussion](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/58957_37b6723ee52b455990e149edde45e5b6.html) as once again, they do not follow allowed entry values. These should be one of B or b = Billion, M or m = Million, K or k = Thousand, H or h = Hundred.

Fortunately, since we are only approaching this after subsetting the data, the values remaining all fit within those allowed values:

```{r show_exp_types}
unique(dfEvents$PROPDMGEXP)
unique(dfEvents$CROPDMGEXP)
```

For the sake of completeness, I have included and catered for all encountered values in the original dataset in the case that a newer set of data is imported in the future. 

We use a function to apply to the dataset where we calculate either property or crop damage and apply the inflation adjustment at the same time:

```{r calculate_cost}
calculate_cost <- function(observation, prefix, annual_inflation){
  DMG=as.numeric(observation[prefix])
  if (DMG <= 0 | is.na(DMG)) {
    # skip if cost is zero
    0
  } else {
    # read EXP value and apply relative factoring to cost
    EXP <- paste0(prefix,'EXP')
    exponent <- toupper(observation[EXP])
    cost <- case_when(
      exponent == 'H' ~ DMG * 1e2,
      exponent == 'K' ~ DMG * 1e3,
      exponent == 'M' ~ DMG * 1e6,
      exponent == 'B' ~ DMG * 1e9,
      is.numeric(exponent) ~ DMG * 10,
      TRUE ~ DMG
    )
    # adjust for relevant years of inflation
    round(cost * ((1 + annual_inflation) ** as.numeric(observation['inflation_period'])))
  }
}

```

Now we use this function for the property and crop values:

```{r calc_costs}
# create calculated property damage cost column
dfEvents <- dfEvents %>% 
  mutate(
    PROPERTY_DAMAGE = apply(
      dfEvents, 
      1, 
      calculate_cost, 
      prefix='PROPDMG', 
      annual_inflation = mean_inflation_rate
    )
  )

# create calculated crop damage cost column
dfEvents <- dfEvents %>% 
  mutate(
    CROP_DAMAGE = apply(
      dfEvents, 
      1, 
      calculate_cost, 
      prefix='CROPDMG', 
      annual_inflation = mean_inflation_rate
    )
  )
dfEvents %>%
  select(BGN_DATE, Event, PROPERTY_DAMAGE, CROP_DAMAGE) %>%
  slice_head(n=10)
```

### Checking for, and fixing, erroneous entries

Looking at max values of each of the indicator columns, we can check for spurious values:

```{r check_max}
dfEvents %>% summarise(
  max(FATALITIES),
  max(INJURIES),
  max(PROPERTY_DAMAGE)/1e9,
  max(CROP_DAMAGE)/1e9
)
```

The value of $137 Billion property damage seems excessive. 

Check the date of the event:

```{r check_date}
refnum <- dfEvents %>% 
  filter(PROPERTY_DAMAGE == max(PROPERTY_DAMAGE))
refnum <- as.numeric(refnum$REFNUM)
dfEvents$BGN_DATE[dfEvents$REFNUM == refnum]
```

Checking the [NOAA website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events/US/2005-2006) for any events recorded with this value during this period shows no events even close.

We can look at the remarks for this event:

```{r check_remark}
dfEvents$REMARKS[dfEvents$REFNUM == refnum]
```

The discussion appears to be talking of values in the league of \$100 Million rather than \$100 Billion. 

We can assume this was mis-keyed with a `B` instead of an `M`.

Correcting this:

```{r fix_outlier}
dfEvents$PROPDMGEXP[dfEvents$REFNUM == refnum] <- 'M'
dfEvents$PROPERTY_DAMAGE[dfEvents$REFNUM == refnum] <- 
  dfEvents$PROPERTY_DAMAGE[dfEvents$REFNUM == refnum] / 1000

dfEvents$PROPERTY_DAMAGE[dfEvents$REFNUM == refnum]

```

The corrected value is now \$`r round(dfEvents$PROPERTY_DAMAGE[dfEvents$REFNUM == refnum]/1e6)` Million.

```{r recheck_max}
# Recheck for spurious values:
dfEvents %>% summarise(
  max(FATALITIES),
  max(INJURIES),
  max(PROPERTY_DAMAGE)/1e9,
  max(CROP_DAMAGE)/1e9
)
```

The maximum values now appear realistic.

# Results

## Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

For this analysis, we look at deaths and injuries attributed to each event type over the 16 year period:

```{r health_summary}
human_damage <- dfEvents %>% 
  group_by(Event) %>% 
  summarise(
    Deaths = sum(FATALITIES),
    Injuries = sum(INJURIES),
    Total = sum(Deaths + Injuries)
    ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))  %>%
  slice_head(n=10) %>%
  mutate(Event = factor(Event, levels=unique(Event)))

human_damage %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed"))
```

*Ten most severe Storm Event Types ranked in order of greatest US human cost over 1996 - 2011 period*

```{r plot_health}
plot_ly(data=human_damage, x = ~Event, y = ~Deaths, type = 'bar', name = 'Deaths') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~Injuries, name = 'Injuries') %>%
  layout(title = list(text = paste0('Ten Highest Causes of Human Costs for Period 1996 to 2011 (inclusive)')),
         xaxis = list(title = ""),
         yaxis = list(title = 'Total Count'), 
         barmode = 'stack'
  ) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = F) %>%
  layout(xaxis=list(fixedrange=TRUE)) %>% 
  layout(yaxis=list(fixedrange=TRUE))
```

From this we can discern that the event type with the highest mortality rate is due to excessive heat, followed by tornadoes.

By far, the most injurious type are tornadoes.

## Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

For this analysis, we look at property and crop damage costs attributed to each event type over the 16 year period:

```{r cost_summary}
financial_damage <- dfEvents %>% 
  group_by(Event) %>% 
  summarise(
    Property = round(sum(PROPERTY_DAMAGE) / 1e9, 2),
    Crop = round(sum(CROP_DAMAGE) / 1e9, 2),
    Total = sum(Property + Crop)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total)) %>%
  slice_head(n=10) %>%
  mutate(Event = factor(Event, levels=unique(Event)))


financial_damage %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed"))
```

*Ten most severe Storm Event Types ranked in order of greatest US damage cost over 1996 - 2011 period.<br>Damage costs in USD Billions adjusted to 2012 USD value.*

```{r plot_damage}
plot_ly(data=financial_damage, x = ~Event, y = ~Property, type = 'bar', name = 'Property') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~Crop, name = 'Crop') %>%
  layout(title = list(text = paste0(
    'Ten Highest Causes of Damage Costs for Period 1996 to 2011 (inclusive)',
    '<br>',
    '<sup>',
    '(USD adjusted to 2012 US Dollar Value)',
    '</sup>'
  )
  ),
  xaxis = list(title = ""),
  yaxis = list(title = 'Total Damage Cost'), 
  barmode = 'stack'
  ) %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = F) %>%
  layout(xaxis=list(fixedrange=TRUE)) %>% 
  layout(yaxis=list(fixedrange=TRUE))
```

The greatest damage to property comes from Hurricanes, however if we look at the three flood related categories combined (Storm Surge/Tide, Flood and Flash Flood), these add up to a greater cost. 

The analysis is a product of the categorization of the allowed event types and perhaps these should in reality be grouped together. It should also be kept in mind that some of these flood events will be related to the hurricanes.

The greatest crop damage is due to drought.

## Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the economic data

Looking at the table of top ten events, we can see five of the first six events are all related to Hurricane Katrina:

```{r top10_events}
# Consider property and crop damage as one
dfEvents <- dfEvents %>%
  mutate(DAMAGE = PROPERTY_DAMAGE + CROP_DAMAGE)

#Top 10 financial events
top10_financial_events <- dfEvents %>%
  select(BGN_DATE, EVTYPE, FATALITIES, INJURIES, DAMAGE) %>%
  mutate(DAMAGE=round((DAMAGE/1e9),2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(DAMAGE)) %>%
  slice_head(n=10)

top10_financial_events %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed"))
```

*Ten most severe storm events ranked in order of greatest US damage cost over 1996 - 2011 period.<br>Damage costs in USD Billions adjusted to 2012 USD value.*

We can look at these by filtering on billion dollar events over the period 27th to 30th August 2005:

```{r katrina_events}
katrina <- dfEvents %>%
  filter(BGN_DATE>='2005-08-27' & BGN_DATE<='2005-08-30' & DAMAGE>1e9) %>%
  select(BGN_DATE, EVTYPE, DAMAGE, REFNUM, REMARKS)

katrina_sum <- sum(katrina$DAMAGE)/1e9
total_sum <- sum(dfEvents$DAMAGE)/1e9
# katrina effect
katrina_percent <- round(katrina_sum * 100 / total_sum)
```

\$`r round(katrina_sum)` billion - total of Katrina Billion Dollar events<br>
\$`r round(total_sum)` billion - total of all events over 1995-2011 period<br>
\------------<br>
`r katrina_percent`% - contribution of Katrina events to total damage over the 1995-2011 period

**Does the effect of this mega event skew the data for the rest of the period?**

We can consider the data again with the Katrina events omitted:

```{r cost_no_kat}
top10_financial_events_no_katrina <- dfEvents %>% 
  filter(REFNUM %nin% katrina$REFNUM) %>%
  group_by(Event) %>% 
  summarise(
    Property = round(sum(PROPERTY_DAMAGE) / 1e9, 2),
    Crop = round(sum(CROP_DAMAGE) / 1e9, 2),
    Total = sum(Property + Crop)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total)) %>%
  slice_head(n=10) %>%
  mutate(Event = factor(Event, levels=unique(Event)))

top10_financial_events_no_katrina %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed"))
```

*Ten most severe storm events ranked in order of greatest US damage cost over 1996 - 2011 period with Katrina events omitted.<br>Damage costs in USD Billions adjusted to 2012 USD value.*

Cumulatively, hurricanes still are #1 cause, however flood and flash flood combined almost equal this value.

Conclusion, the Katrina event does not skew the data.

**Are these floods linked to the hurricane events as happened with Katrina?**

We can look at the top five contributors for each year:

```{r top5_yr_no_kat}
top5_by_year_no_katrina <- dfEvents %>% 
  filter(REFNUM %nin% katrina$REFNUM) %>%
  group_by(Year=year(BGN_DATE), Event) %>% 
  summarise(
    Total = round(sum(DAMAGE) / 1e9, 2)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))  %>% 
  arrange(Year, desc(Total)) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by=Total, n=5) %>%
  slice_head(n=5)

p <- ggplot(top5_by_year_no_katrina, aes(x=Year, y=Total, color=Event)) 
p + geom_line(aes(group=Event)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(top5_by_year_no_katrina$Year)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:ceiling(max(top5_by_year_no_katrina$Total))) +
  xlab(NULL) + 
  ylab("Total Damage Cost") +
  labs(
    title = "Total Damage Costs for Top 5 Event Types in Each Year with Katrina data omitted", 
    subtitle = "(USD adjusted to 2012 US Dollar Value)",
    color = "Event Type", 
    ) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

The graph doesn't show any strong relationship between hurricane peaks and flooding.

Other than the hurricane spikes in 2004/2005, no particular event dominates each year, rather it's a cumulative effect over the years that dominates.

**Conclusion:** 

Hurricanes and the various forms of flooding cause the greatest economic damage even when omitting the Hurricane Katrina mega event.
